If you have reached our website via an ad placed by Google, Google Ads will set a cookie on your computer. The conversion tracking cookie is set when a user clicks on an ad placed by Google. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If the user visits certain pages of our website and the cookie has not yet expired, we and Google can recognize that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to this page. Each Google Ads customer receives a different cookie. Cookies can therefore not be tracked across Ads customers&#x27; websites. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for Ads customers who have opted in to conversion tracking. Clients learn the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page tagged with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information that can be used to personally identify users.
If you do not wish to participate in the tracking, you can refuse the setting of a cookie required for this - for example, by means of a browser setting that generally deactivates the automatic setting of cookies or by setting your browser so that cookies from the domain &quot;&quot;googleleadservices.com&quot;&quot; are blocked.

For this purpose, your input is transmitted to Google and further used there. However, your IP address will be shortened beforehand by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.

The legal basis for the use of Google Analytics is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f DS-GVO. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other data from Google. We would like to point out that on this website Google Analytics has been extended by the code &quot;&quot;_anonymizeIp();&quot;&quot; to ensure anonymized collection of IP addresses. This means that IP addresses are processed in abbreviated form, which means that they cannot be linked to a specific person. If the data collected about you is related to a person, this is immediately excluded and the personal data is deleted immediately.
Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.

Partial processing of user data takes place on WhatsApp servers in the USA.</p><p>Through the certification according to the EU-US Privacy Shield, WhatsApp guarantees, however, that the data protection requirements of the EU are also complied with when processing data in the USA. In addition, WhatsApp offers further data protection information.</p><p>To receive our newsletter via WhatsApp, you need a WhatsApp user account. Details about which data WhatsApp collects during registration can be found in the aforementioned WhatsApp data protection information.</p><p>If you then register to receive our newsletter via WhatsApp, the cell phone number you entered during the registration process will be processed by WhatsApp. In addition, your IP address and the date and time of your registration will be stored. In the course of the further registration process, your consent to the sending of the newsletter will be obtained, the content will be specifically described and reference will be made to this privacy policy.</p><p>The legal basis for the sending of the newsletter and the analysis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a.)

This website uses the services of Active Campaign for sending newsletters. The provider is the US provider ActiveCampaign, LLC, 150 N. Michigan Ave Suite 1230, Chicago, IL, US, USA.</p><p>Active Campaign is a service with which, among other things, the dispatch of newsletters can be organized and analyzed.

The &quot;&quot;Privacy Shield&quot;&quot; is an agreement between the European Union (EU) and the USA to ensure compliance with European data protection standards in the USA.</p><p>Active Campaign allows us to analyze our newsletter campaigns. When you open an email sent with Active Campaign, a file contained in the email (known as a web beacon) connects to Active Campaign&#x27;s servers in the USA. This makes it possible to determine whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links, if any, have been clicked on. In addition, technical information is recorded (e.g. time of retrieval, IP address, browser type and operating system). This information cannot be assigned to the respective newsletter recipient. It is used exclusively for the statistical analysis of newsletter campaigns. The results of these analyses can be used to better adapt future newsletters to the interests of the recipients.</p><p>If you do not want any analysis by Active Campaign, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a corresponding link in every newsletter message. Furthermore, you can also unsubscribe from the newsletter directly on our website.</p><p>The data processing is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO). You can revoke this consent at any time by unsubscribing from the newsletter. The legality of the data processing operations already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation.</p><p>The data you have provided to us for the purpose of receiving the newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and will be deleted from our servers as well as from the servers of Active Campaign after you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Data that has been stored by us for other purposes (e.g. e-mail addresses for the member area) remains unaffected by this.</p><p>For more details, please refer to Active Campaign&#x27;s privacy policy at: <a href="https://www.activecampaign.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.activecampaign.com/privacy-policy/</a>.</p><p>Link to Privacy Shield certification: <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.privacyshield.gov</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion-of-a-data-processing-agreement">Conclusion of a data processing agreement<a href="#conclusion-of-a-data-processing-agreement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion of a data processing agreement" title="Direct link to Conclusion of a data processing agreement">​</a></h3><p>We have concluded a so-called &quot;&quot;Data-Processing-Agreement&quot;&quot; with Active Campaign, in which we oblige Active Campaign to protect the data of our customers and not to pass them on to third parties.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="adobe-fonts">Adobe Fonts<a href="#adobe-fonts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Adobe Fonts" title="Direct link to Adobe Fonts">​</a></h3><p>We use Adobe Fonts for the visual design of our website.
