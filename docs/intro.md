# Welcome & About this Wiki

Greetings! Welcome to this Wiki and Blog which is about **Data & Analytics with Power BI** from Microsoft.

My name is Jon and I am a project leader for business intelligence and analytics projects at **DataVision** in Zurich, Switzerland. My daily job is to design and implement analytics solutions based on Power BI for a broad range of different customers from various different industries. My job allowed me to gain a deep understanding of what works well and what not, how best practice for robust solution design looks like and how to make an analytics project a success. With this Wiki and Blog, I want to share some of that knowledge.

If you would like to connect & chat, please find my LinkedIn profile here: [<ins>LinkedIn Profile of Jon</ins>](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-cajacob-cfa-frm-4876857b/)
