# Welcome & About this Wiki

Greetings! Welcome to this Wiki and Blog which is about **Data & Analytics with Power BI** from Microsoft.

My name is Jon and I am a project leader for business intelligence and analytics projects at **DataVision** in Zurich, Switzerland. My daily job is to design and implement business intelligence and analytics solutions with **Microsoft Power BI** for a broad portfolio of customers from various different industries. My job allowed me to gain a deep understanding of what works well and what not, how best practice for robust solution design looks like and how to make an analytics project a success. Having a Wiki or Blog was on my mind for a while and with this page I want to make it reality and share some of my knowledge.

If you would like to connect & chat, please find my LinkedIn profile here: [<ins>LinkedIn Profile of Jon</ins>](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-cajacob-cfa-frm-4876857b/)

## Business Intelligence & Analytics with Microsoft Power BI (book in progress)

When I started to write blog articles, I learned that this is something I really like doing. Blog articles though are individual pieces of knowledge and what is missing for me is a coherent structure that connects this knowledge. I therefore decided to write a book accordingly. The idea or goal of the book is to walk step-by-step through the implementation of a typical BI solution with Power BI. 

The book shall contain a more generalized overview of the typical components of a BI solution. The larger part however uses an exemplary sales analysis use-case to show how to build a full solution with Power BI.
