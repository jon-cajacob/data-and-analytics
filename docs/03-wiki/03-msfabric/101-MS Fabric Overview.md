# MS Fabric Overview

## Things we can do with MS Fabric (by no means a complete list)

- Access a data table in a Lakehouse via a Gen2 Dataflow, manipulating the data and then loading it again to the same Lakehouse (e.g. implementation of Bronze-Silver-Gold architecture)
- Chain several Dataflows in a Pipeline and execute the whole chain. Send automatically an e-mail in case of success (or failure)
