# 3.1 | Chapter overview

In this chapter we will build the automated data preparation process for the demo sales dataset with Power Query. We will first connect Power BI with the Excel-file containing the demo data. Following that, we will first prepare the dimension tables and then the fact tables step-by-step. At the end of this chapter, we will tidy up Power Query and load the data tables to the data model.
