# 2.3 | Buildings blocks of a business intelligence solution

## 2.3.1 | Overview

In this chapter, I want to give an overview and a short description of the building blocks of a typical business intelligence solution. Further, I will explain how the different building blocks are integrated with each other in what I call a data value chain. 

To make it less theoretical, I will always give an example of how a certain element of the solution is implemented with Power BI. However please note, all these elements are relevant for any analytics solution, independent of the specific software used.

The following illustration gives an overview of how a business intelligence solution is structured:

## 2.3.2 | Project and agile management

Designing and implementing a BI solution is a project and should be managed accordingly. How such a project should then be organized and managed in detail is specific to the given situation and framework of an organization. I will therefore not attempt to generalize it, however, I want to note down a few recommendations and guiding principles from my own practice which I know are strong instruments to increase the likelihood of the project being successful.

Given its importance, I first want to summarize my understanding and give an overview of agile project management. After that, I will list my recommendations on how to apply agile in the world of business intelligence and analytics.

**Agile management**

Agile has its roots in software development and it has become very popular in recent years. Today, it is the standard for IT departments in organizations to apply agile management principles and methods. It has become so relevant, that it is a full-time profession for some, like "Agile Coach" or "Scrum Master".

In my own words, I like to explain agile as a concious effort to understand a project as a journey where learnings along the way are continuously incorporated into the process and the required solution is refined more and more over time. This method is very powerful and makes a lot of sense because in every project's beginning you have very little knowhow of how the final product should actually look like, function and be integrated in the existing organizational framework. Given that, the standard working mode in agile is to develop parts of the overall solution in an iterative approach with continuous feedback from the customer. The integrated sum of these iteratively developed small "packages" results then in the overall solution and product.

Reduces risk
Better overall solution (better fit)
reduces costs


Keep it simple
