# 5.1 | Chapter overview

We have so far created the automated data preparation process with Power Query and loaded the prepared data tables to the data model. Then we built the table relationships between the dimension and fact tables and configured different data model settings. Given that, we are now in the position and ready to start creating visualizations and custom calculations, i.e. measures with DAX.

This chapter aims to give an introduction to the various functionalities available when building visualizations and reports. Further, we will discuss and try to understand important concepts about the functional language DAX which is crucial for creating our KPIs. Please, not DAX is a tremendously powerful language and it is hard to master because of its abstract nature. So please do not stress yourself if you find the chapters about measures hard to follow at first.
