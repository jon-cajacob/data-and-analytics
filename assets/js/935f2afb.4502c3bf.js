built into Power BI and Microsoft Excel. With Power Query, we can connect with various different data sources, extract required data and transform and load it into tables (dimensions and facts) which can be used to build the data model. This automated process is generally referred to as \\"ETL\\", whichs stands for extract, transform and load. Preparing data is necessary and important because data in its raw form stored in data sources is rarely in the shape required for the business intelligence solution.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"book/chapter2/02-04-solution-design":{"id":"book/chapter2/02-04-solution-design","title":"2.4 | Building blocks of a business intelligence solution","description":"2.3.1 | Overview","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"book/chapter2/02-05-overview-example":{"id":"book/chapter2/02-05-overview-example","title":"2.5 | Overview and files for the example use-case in this book","description":"The focus of this book is the step-by-step development of a close-to-practice use-case with a demo dataset consisting of multiple dimension and fact tables.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"book/chapter3/03-01-chapter-overview":{"id":"book/chapter3/03-01-chapter-overview","title":"3.1 | Chapter overview","description":"In this chapter we will build the automated data preparation process for the demo sales dataset with Power Query. We will first connect Power BI with the Excel-file containing the demo data. Following that, we will first prepare the dimension tables and then the fact tables step-by-step. At the end of this chapter, we will tidy up Power Query and load the data tables to the data model.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"book/chapter3/03-02-connect":{"id":"book/chapter3/03-02-connect","title":"3.2 | Connecting Power BI with the example data Excel file","description":"With the following steps, we create a new Power BI Desktop file (.pbix) and we connect with the Excel file containing the demo data (in multiple tabs).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"book/chapter3/03-03-prepare-1":{"id":"book/chapter3/03-03-prepare-1","title":"3.3 | Preparing the customer dimension (dimCustomer)","description":"After connecting the Excel file and its data tables, we will now proceed with preparing the individual dimension and fact tables using data transformation steps in Power Query.

For this table, some transformation steps are the same as for dimCustomer (in general you will notice over time that there is a certain set of transformations that is relevant for almost all data tables). Some transformation steps are new and will broaden your understanding of Power Query.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"book/chapter3/03-05-prepare-3":{"id":"book/chapter3/03-05-prepare-3","title":"3.5 | Preparing the sales channel dimension (dimSalesChannel)","description":"The sales channel dimension dimSalesChannel is only a small table and there are not many transformation steps required to prepare it for the data model.

Remember, a fact table contains transactional data telling us what has happened when. With the associated dimensions we can describe what has happened in the facts by filtering, slicing and aggregating fact data.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"book/chapter3/03-08-prepare-6":{"id":"book/chapter3/03-08-prepare-6","title":"3.8 | Preparing the sales forecast fact table (factForecast)","description":"In the previous chapter we prepared the fact table factSales which contains the actual sales transactions that happened over time.
