With Power Query, we can connect with various different data sources, extract required data and transform and load it into tables (dimensions and facts) which can be used to build the data model. This automated process is generally referred to as \\"ETL\\", whichs stands for extract, transform and load. Preparing data is necessary and important because data in its raw form stored in data sources is rarely in the shape required for the business intelligence solution.","permalink":"/2.3"},{"id":"book/chapter2/02-04-solution-design","title":"2.4 | Building blocks of a business intelligence solution","description":"2.3.1 | Overview","permalink":"/2.4"},{"id":"book/chapter2/02-05-overview-example","title":"2.5 | Overview and files for the example use-case in this book","description":"The focus of this book is the step-by-step development of a close-to-practice use-case with a demo dataset consisting of multiple dimension and fact tables.","permalink":"/2.5"},{"id":"book/chapter4/04-03-model-properties","title":"4.3 | Data model properties","description":"Let\'s go through some of the data model properties which we can configure.","permalink":"/4.3"},{"id":"book/chapter4/04-04-date-table","title":"4.4 | Date table settings","description":"The date dimension table is a crucial component of our data model and there are certain configurations necessary for it.","permalink":"/4.4"},{"id":"book/chapter5/05-01-chapter-overview","title":"5.1 | Chapter overview","description":"We have so far created the automated data preparation process with Power Query and loaded the prepared data tables to the data model.
