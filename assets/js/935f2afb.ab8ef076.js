built into Power BI and Microsoft Excel. With Power Query, we can connect with various different data sources, extract required data and transform and load it into tables (dimensions and facts) which can be used to build the data model. This automated process is generally referred to as \\"ETL\\", whichs stands for extract, transform and load. Preparing data is necessary and important because data in its raw form stored in data sources is rarely in the shape required for a business intelligence solution and its data model architecture.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"book/chapter2/02-04-solution-design":{"id":"book/chapter2/02-04-solution-design","title":"2.4 | Building blocks of a business intelligence solution","description":"2.3.1 | Overview","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"book/chapter2/02-05-overview-example":{"id":"book/chapter2/02-05-overview-example","title":"2.5 | Sales demo use-case used in this book (download data)","description":"The focus of this book is the step-by-step development of a close-to-practice use-case with a demo dataset consisting of multiple dimension and fact tables.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"book/chapter3/03-01-chapter-overview":{"id":"book/chapter3/03-01-chapter-overview","title":"3.1 | Chapter overview","description":"In this chapter we will build the automated data preparation process for the demo sales dataset with Power Query.

For this table, some transformation steps are the same as for dimCustomer (in general you will notice over time that there is a certain set of transformations that is relevant for almost all data tables). Some transformation steps are new and will broaden your understanding of Power Query.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"book/chapter3/03-05-prepare-3":{"id":"book/chapter3/03-05-prepare-3","title":"3.5 | Preparing the sales channel dimension (dimSalesChannel)","description":"The sales channel dimension dimSalesChannel is only a small table and there are not many transformation steps required to prepare it for the data model.
